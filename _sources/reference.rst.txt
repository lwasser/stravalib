API Reference
=============
This is another approach to API documentation that feels a bit more readable compared
to vanilla autodoc. The downside is that i'm manuall adding methods. The upside
is that it's very easy to see the various methods and classes in a readable format.'
I think in the long run readibility may make it easier for others to contribute.



The API Reference provides an overview of all public objects, functions and methods implemented in GeoPandas.
All classes and function exposed in ``geopandas.*`` namespace plus those listed in the reference are public.
