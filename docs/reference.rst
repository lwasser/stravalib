API Reference
=============
This is another approach to API documentation that feels a bit more readable compared
to vanilla autodoc. The downside is that i'm manuall adding methods. The upside
is that it's very easy to see the various methods and classes in a readable format.'
I think in the long run readibility may make it easier for others to contribute.
